/// ```rust
/// # use anyhow::Error;
/// # use explorer::{explorer_service_server::*, service::Explorer};
/// # use tonic::transport::Server;
/// # use std::net::SocketAddr;
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
///     let addr: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?;
///     let service = ExplorerServiceServer::new(Explorer {});
///
///     // (Commented out so that the doc-tests don't block running an actual server)
///     // Server::builder().add_service(service).serve(addr).await?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
/// NOTE: The generated code requires you to create a struct that implements the [`ExplorerService`]
/// trait. I would have preferred for this struct to have been named `ExamineService`...but that is
/// already the trait's name! ðŸ¤” I might want to find a better name than `Examine` if this were a
/// real project.
